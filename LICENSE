Attribution and Collaboration Notice:

This project is released publicly to support transparency, reproducibility, and scientific collaboration.

While fully open-source under Apache 2.0, meaningful reuse (e.g., running the benchmark at full scale) may involve substantial infrastructure costs. Casual duplication is unlikely, but deliberate adoption by research groups or companies is encouraged.

If you reuse this framework, please:
- Include proper attribution and a link to the original repository
- Indicate any modifications
- Consider reaching out for co-authorship or collaboration if you're extending or publishing results
