-- File: fix_all_sequences.sql
-- Purpose: Automatically reset all sequences to match max(id) per table
--
-- ðŸ›  Why this is needed:
-- When restoring the database from a backup (e.g., via `make backup-db`),
-- PostgreSQL does not automatically sync sequences (like sample_records_id_seq)
-- to reflect the current data in the table. This can lead to "duplicate key"
-- errors on insert if a sequence is still pointing to an ID that already exists.
--
-- This script loops over all sequences in the database and resets each one
-- to the maximum existing ID in the corresponding table (or 1 if empty).
--
-- ðŸ“¦ This file is executed automatically during `make backup-db`
-- as part of the `fix-sequences` Makefile target.
